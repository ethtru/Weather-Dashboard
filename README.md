# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

This is a weather forecast application that displays the current day forecast in the main container located in the middle of the page, and the five subsequent days in smaller containers underneath. The weather data includes the temperature, humidity, and wind speed for the given city.

## Approach

This application was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Open Weather Map API was employed to pull weather data for a given city. Once a city is entered into the seach box, and the search button is pressed, data from the API is pulled and displayed on the page. The 'fetch' function pulled data from the API, and a 'for loop' generated the five day forecast.
